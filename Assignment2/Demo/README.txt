Run executable, and there are projects with number. Type number of project that you want to test.
You must use only integer number for menu.

For project 1 and 2, you need to type initial conditions. There would be description about which input do you need to type.
You must type only numeric values and not more than one number at once.

For project 3, there are some constraints for input file.
- There must be a file named "Data.txt" in the same directory with executable.
- There must be exactly 4 values for each line.
- Each value must be separated by white space, so for example, Course Grade would be two values. It must be CourseGrade.
- First line of file must be names of each variable.
- The order of 4 values is x1, x2, x3, and y. e.g. Midterm, Homework, Quiz, and CouseGrade.
- Below the first line, there must be only numbers.
Indeed, just copy of .xlsx file into .txt file is valid.
I attached valid Data.txt file which I copied from Coding2_Data.xlsx.
